# Arduino Midi Controller
This project is based on arduino midi library. Its main goal is to design home made midi controllers with knobs.
## Install
You need to install hairless midi and loop midi to get midi input from serial port and redirect it to a virtual midi device.
Its compatible with all arduino models.
## Circuit
You need to connect a potentiometer to analog input 2 and a button to digital input 2.
## Using
After you done all the things you can enable your virtual midi device from your favorite program(FL Studio, Ableton Live, etc).
Then you can use midi mapping to the desired knob on the software.
